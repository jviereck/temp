\section{Introduction}

In this experiment, some of the basic concepts of digital circuits are explored.
Digital circuits contain logic gate. The gates transform a
digital input signal into some digital output signal following a well defined functionality.
The input and output signal are either ``high/1'' or ``low/0''. This is a main
difference compared to the analogous circuits, which have a continuous range of
input/output signals. In today's world gates play an important role in. Every
digital circuit contains a few up to multiple billions of them.

TODO: Write something about IC.

Gates can be categorized by gate-family, that they belong to (e.g. TTL or CMOS)
and some other specific properties. Gates perform different operations to
``compute'' the output signal based on some input signal. Also, gates differ in
terms of propagation delay, which is the delay a change in one of the input
signals takes to cause a change in the output signal. The propagation delay is
very important when designing digital circuits.

In the following, the performed experiments are presented. The experiments
describe how to determine the operation performed by a digital circuit and it's
propagation delay, how a pulse generator is build and how to implement a very
simple bit shifter logic.

\section{Experiment: Simple Logic Gate}

\subsection{Samples and measurement setup}

\begin{figure}[h!]
  \centering
   \includegraphics[]{boards/truth.png}
   \caption{Circuit diagram to measure truth table.}
   \label{fig:truth_circuit}
\end{figure}

The circuit was setup as shown in figure \ref{fig:truth_circuit}. Based on the
different input signals at A and B, different values for the output signal C
were measured using a oscilloscope. As for the ICs, a HCF4001BE and HCF4011BE
were used.

To measure the propagation delay, input signal A was connect to a square wave
voltage generator. Input signal B was connected to ground. The IC HCF4001BE
was used for this measurement. The voltage of the generator was set to 2.9V and
the frequency to 1Hz. The input signal A and output signal C was visualized
using a oscilloscope. The oscilloscope's trigger signal was connected to the voltage
generator.

  \label{fig:propdelay}
\end{figure}

For different input signals A and B, the truth-table was measured as
shown in table \ref{tab:truthtable}.

The propagation delay was measured to be around 50ns as seen in figure
\ref{fig:propdelay}.

\subsection{Analysis and Discussion}

Based on the measurements, the IC HCF4001BE seems to be a logic NOR gate,
whereas the IC HCF4011BE seems to function as a NAND gate. This fits with the
specified functionality of the gates.

Looking up the propagation delay from the data sheet, it is said to be typically
around 40ns and up to 75ns. This fits with the here measured delay.

\section{Experiment: Pulse Generator}

A pulse generators are used to create rectangular, periodic voltage signals. In
this experiment, such a generator was build and its properties examined. 

\subsection{Samples and measurement setup}

\begin{figure}[h!]
  \centering
   \includegraphics[]{boards/astabil_multivibrator.png}
   \caption{Circuit diagram of astable multivibrator.}
   \label{fig:am_board}
\end{figure}

The circuit was assembled as shown in figure \ref{fig:am_board}. Here, the IC
HCF4069UBE was used, which contains six NOT gates. The voltage difference
between the output signals $O1$, $O2$ and the ground was quantified using an
oscilloscope. This also allowed to visualize and measure the period of the
oscillations.
Different values for the resistance $R1$ and the capacity $C1$ were chosen and
the resulting period of the voltage signals determined.

\subsection{Functionality explanation}

\begin{figure}[h!]
  \centering
   \includegraphics[]{boards/am_overview.png}
   \caption{schematic drawing of the astable multivibrator circuit.}
   \label{fig:am_scheme}
\end{figure}

A schematic drawing of the circuit is presented in figure \ref{fig:am_scheme}.
The explanation follows the one given in \cite{book_dg}. Let's assume the
voltage at $O1$ is set to be \emph{high} and the capacitor is uncharged. Due to
the \emph{high} signal at $O1$, the signal at $O2$ is \emph{low}. Over the
resistance $R1$ the capacitor is charged. At some point, the voltage at $I1$ is high enough, such
that the input signal of $ICA$ is recognized as \emph{high}. This causes the
signal at $O1$ to become \emph{low} and therefore the signal at $O2$ to be
\emph{high}. The charged capacitor discharges, which keeps the \emph{high}
signal at the $I1$ input for some time until the voltage on the capacitor is to
low, such that the signal at $I1$ is recognized as a \emph{low} signal, the
signal at $O1$ becomes a \emph{high} one and things start over again.

   \caption{Measurement of period time $t$ as function of resistance $R$ and
   capacity $C$.}
   \label{fig:am_result}
\end{figure}


The time diagram for the voltage at $O1$ and $O2$ is visualized in figure
\ref{fig:am_timing}. In table \ref{fig:am_result} different period times $t$ due 
to different choices of resistance $R$ and capacity $C$ are listed. The values
for the resistances and the capacities shown here are excluding a manufacturing
error of roughly up to $10\%$. Some of the capacities were more precise
measured and are listed in the $C*$ column.

\subsection{Analysis and Discussion}

The k-value is defined as

\begin{equation}
	k = \frac{t}{R \cdot C}
	\label{eq:k}
\end{equation}

where $t$ is the period time, $R$ is the resistance of the resistor
\em{R} and $C$ is the capacity of the capacitor \em{C}. Based on the
measurements, the k-values are computed in table \ref{fig:am_result} in the $k$
column. For the more precisely measured capacities $C*$, the k-value $k*$ was
computed using the $C*$ value.

As mentioned in \cite{book_dg}, the relation between $t$ and the other
quantities is given by

\begin{equation}
	t = 2~R~C~\ln(3) \approx 2.2~R~C
\end{equation}

which gives the value of $k$ using equation (\ref{eq:k}) as

\begin{equation}
	k = 2~\ln(3) \approx 2.2
	\label{eq:k_lit}
\end{equation}

The average values of $k$ and $k*$ given in table \ref{fig:am_result} match very
well with the expected values for k. Using the standard derivation of the average as
an indicator for the uncertainty of the here measured $k$ and $k*$ values, the
literal value is within the range of average +- standard derivation. However,
the standard derivation is larger then 1/10 of the average value. This indicates
a high uncertainty in the measured quantities.

\begin{figure}
  \centering
   \includegraphics[trim=50mm 90mm 45mm 125mm, clip,
   width=\columnwidth,page=2]{results/am_data.pdf}
   \caption{Measurement of period time $t$ as function of resistance $R$ and
   capacity $C$.}
   \label{fig:am_plot}
\end{figure}

The last column $Lit - \<k*\>$ holds the difference between the literature value
(\ref{eq:k_lit}) and the calculated $k*$ value and therefore a simple error
estimation between measurement and literature value. The error is calculated for
the same capacitor $C = 200\text{nF}$. A plot of these errors is shown in figure
\ref{fig:am_plot}. The X-axis is plotted logarithmically. The shape of the curve
suggests a exponential relation between $R$ and the error. As the $k*$ values
are roughly the same for different choices of $C$, this might be an indication,
that the error is mostly related to the choice of the resistance. The reason for
this correspondence remained unclear to the author.

\section{Experiment: Self Build Digital Circuit}

In the last experiment, a shift operation was designed and implemented. For
simplicity, the shifter presented is made up of only two input signals and zero
or one shift to the left. Written as a programming expression, this
corresponds to:

\begin{equation}
	\{0, 1, 2, 3\} ~ \texttt{<<} ~ \{0, 1\}
\end{equation}

where the numbers in brackets represent all possible values. The result of the
calculation was made visible to the user by using three LEDs.

\subsection{Samples and measurement setup}

To get an idea how the circuit should setup, the required logical operations
were determined as:

 
\begin{equation}
\begin{tabular}{ c l }
      \text{LED1} &= I1 \wedge \lnot S \\
		\text{LED2} &= (I2 \wedge \lnot S) \vee (I1 \wedge S) \\
		\text{LED3} &= (I2 \wedge S)
\end{tabular}
	\label{eq:}
\end{equation}
	
where $I1$, $I2$ are the two input signal for the number to shift (the
number is represented in binary form), $S$ indicates if a shift should happen
(if high, do a shift on the input $I1$, $I2$) and LED\{1,2,3\} are the LEDs
showing the result of the operation.

\begin{figure}[h!]
  \centering
   \includegraphics[]{boards/shifter.png}
   \caption{Scheme of the shifter circuit.}
   \label{fig:shifter}
\end{figure}

After looking up the required components, the circuit was sketched out as shown
in figure \ref{fig:shifter}. The four AND operations were covered using the IC
CD4081GE, the NOT operation using the IC HCF4069UBE, the OR operation was done
by ``just'' connecting two wires. The reasoning for the components R\{1, 2, 3\}
and D\{1, 2\} is provided in the following section.

To determine the propagation delay, input S was connected to a square
wave generator running at 1khz and 5V. The input I2 was opened/set to a ``low''
signal and the I1 input was closed/set to a ``high'' signal. The voltage
difference at LED2 compared to GND was measured by attaching an oscilloscope to
M.

\subsection{Results} 

\begin{figure}
  \centering
   \includegraphics[trim=15mm 75mm 10mm 80mm, clip,
   width=\columnwidth]{img/shift_volt1.pdf}
   \caption{Voltage difference at Point M and Input S compared to GND using
   D1=1N4148PH}
   \label{fig:signal_m1}
\end{figure}

The output signals of the AND gates was oscillating. The LED2 was
shining only very little.

After fixing these issues (see next section), the signal as meassured at the
output M is shown in figure \ref{fig:signal_m1}.

\subsection{Analysis and Discussion}

The oscillation of the AND gate output signal was due to not well set ``low''
signal on the inputs. The first draft missed out the resistors R\{1, 2, 3\}. It
was assumed, that no input signal at a gate input results in a ``low'' signal.
For the here used AND gates, the ``low'' signal needed to be explicit connected to the ground. By using the resistors, the ``high'' signal
for closed switches was detected by the gates, but at the same time for opened
switches, the wire was set to a ``low'' signal. The resistors were chosen to be
$100\Omega$. The choice of $18\Omega$ worked as well, but the resistors got very
hot and therefore got replaced by the $100\Omega$ ones. 

``Just'' connecting the wires for LED2 turned also out to be a bad idea.
A ``high'' signal at one of the wires was attenuate by the ``low'' signal of
the other wire. Therefore, the two diodes D1 and D2 were added. This made the
LED2 shine much brighter.

With these two changes, the shifter was operating as expected.

The waveform in figure \ref{fig:signal_m1} at point M was not expected. It looks
like a discharge curve seen in a resistor-capacity circuit. However, the shifter circuit doesn't
have ``any'' capacities. Replacing the diode D1 with a wire, made the wave
become rectangular. This indicated a relation between the unexpected wave
shape and the used diode.

\begin{figure}

   \includegraphics[trim=15mm 75mm 10mm 80mm, clip,

   \caption{Voltage difference at Point M and Input S compared to GND using
   D1=1N40058912}
   \label{fig:signal_m2}
\end{figure}

The initially used diodes were of the type 1N4148PH. Replacing D1 with the type
1N40058912 changed the waveform's shape as seen in figure \ref{fig:signal_m2}.

	\end{tabular}
	\caption{Used components and their capacities.}
	\label{fig:signal_capacity_real} 
\end{figure}

Trying to understand this behavior, a simplified model was created as displayed
in figure \ref{fig:signal_model}. The model reduces the LED to a diode. Every
diode has a small inner-capacity with the order of pF. These capacities are
added explicit in this model. The oscilloscope used to measure the voltage difference
has itself a resistance of 1M$\Omega$, which was included in the model as well.
For different choices of the the capacity C1 and C2 the circuit was simulated
and the results are shown in figure \ref{fig:signal_model_result}. 

Looking at the used components' capacities as listed in figure
\ref{fig:signal_capacity_real}, the first and the last simulation is match
the used components. While the first simulation curve matches the shape of the
measured curve in figure \ref{fig:signal_m1}, the last simulation doesn't match
the observed curve in figure \ref{fig:signal_m2}; but this measurement fits very
well for the made-up capacities used in the middle simulation. The reason for
this mismatch was not able to be figured out by the author.

Without adjusting the diodes D1 and D2, a rectangular wave was possible to
achieve by connecting M to GND using a resistor with 10k$\Omega$. This follows
the same idea as the resistors introduced at S, I1 and I2.

\section{Conclusion}

The experiments presented here show some important property of digital circuits
and how to measure those. Moreover, by doing a circuit from scratch, some of
the issues designing a digital circuit were enlightened. Constructing a circuit
requires understanding all the components. Otherwise things like the
inner-capacity of diodes or the resistance of the measurement equipment might be
forgotten to be taken into account. These can lead to unexpected behavior, which
were relatively simple to figure out in this setup, but are imagined to be hard
to control on larger circuits.

Given that the here implemented circuit was simple compared to the circuits
shipping with a computer/smartphone, it can only be imagined the hard work it takes to make
large circuits operate precise. The complexity even grows, as there are more and
more components packed on each chip and more functionality is covered by the
same gadget.
